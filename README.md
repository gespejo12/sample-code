# Code Sample
1. Repository Pattern
2. Basic CRUD with Request Validation
3. Resource Routes
4. Handler service with queue job
5. Error log/alert notification using slack
6. View with vuejs

Note: This are just partial code in my previous project. I used modular and repository pattern to setup this project. I usually use vue component in my views but in this example I only used the basic laravel blade with vuejs
